# To-Do List  

To-Do List is a web-based application that allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks easily. This app is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** and supports **local storage** to save the user's task list.  

## Features  

- **Add Tasks with Enter**: Press the Enter key to add a new task without needing a button.  
- **Edit & Delete Buttons**: Each task has two buttonsâ€”one for editing and one for deleting.  
- **Double-Click to Edit**: Double-click on a task title to edit it instantly.  
- **Local Storage Support**: Task lists are automatically saved in the browser, so they remain even after closing the tab.  

## How It Works

1. The user types a new task in the input field and presses **Enter** to add it to the list.  
2. Each added task has an **Edit** and **Delete** button for further management.  
3. Double-click on a task title to edit it instantly.  
4. Task data is automatically stored in the browser's local storage.
